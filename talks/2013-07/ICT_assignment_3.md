# ABOUT INTEROPERATION

presented by Tony and Chenhao

=====

## 1. What interoperability is. 


In IT level, interoperability is about different systems from different vendors being able to exchange data between one another. This data exchange is needed; otherwise the systems cannot work together. Nowadays this is commonly enabled by using open data standards, e.g. the XML language. This can also be reached by using a conversion service that provides the needed conversion on-the-fly.

The dictionary definition is pretty much the same.

## 2. Choose a country.  


Norway.

## 3. IT budget & its relation to GNP of the country 

- It was hard to find figures of what Norway has budgeted for the governmental information systems, but according to Statistics Norway, the expenditure on ICT related to the Administration of the State and the economic and social policy of the community was in 2012 USD 705 million, which adds up to 0.144 percent of the GDP (USD 491.1 Billion in 2012).

- The significance of this is that the systems might get too expensive. If there are problems in planning or implementation, this can create a massive money hole. However, Norway is a rich country and they’ve managed to keep the figures quite reasonable (really reasonable when comparing to the GDP of Norway).

## 4. Governmental information systems  

a. in regular use 
--
Norway launched a program called eNorway,In 2000 for the purpose of creating an ICT system. There are various of different programs in regular use, some successful examples are:   

- My page: to collect all relevant information from the public sector regarding a single citizen to his / her own web page. The citizen themselves can also access the page and add or modify information about themselves as well as their neighbourhood!
- A self-assessment tax return system
- S@mspill: Maintaining a citizen’s lifelong health record, make it convenient for different areas to access the health information
Norge.no,Altinn.no, aimed respectively for private person and business uses, for job applications.
- Geonorge.no: offering geographical data and environmental data regarding Norway.
- many other more.


 
b. in planning stages 
--
eNorway follows these different phases when they are developing their information 
society (recommended by OECD): 

- Establishment phase 1995-2005 
- Expansion phase 2000-2010 
- Change phase 2005-2015 
- Realisation phase 2010-2020
 
The current on going program are at a huge amount, most of which are creating a better system for government employees to access the correct data.

- eAdministration
- electronic education certificates.

## 5. systems interoperable? connections between different systems 

Norway seems to be well aboard the interoperability train. They have e.g. developed Noark, or the Norwegian Model Requirements for Electronic Records Management System, which is used by government agencies for the retrieval of official records based on metadata. This standard requires that everyone who enters a document into the system must follow a strict protocol in order to conform with the standard. 

Norwegian municipalities have a common strategy called eKommune, which aims at improving cross border cooperation, integration and interoperability of the systems used there. eNorway is also “focusing on cross sector initiatives and and projects both across the sectors and between public and private sector.”

For instance, three systems interoperating with each others are My Page, the Tax Return system and S@mspill, the health record system. 

Norway has also created SmartRap, a system used for natural or man made emergency broadcasts. This system consists of diifferent systems communicating with each other through three modules in case of emergency.

## 6. What does it mean that governmental information interoperable? Not interoperable?
 
a. for administrative officials 
--
For the employees,  the interoperatable systems can edit and access data from a person from different level of the government system. There won’t be an information lost or “table format” conversion between the levels of the gorvernment.
Accessibility is defined by permissions. No privileges towards any one  of the government, and  all reasonable needs for information can be satisfied.
All information are transparent. there will not be an obstacle for most part of the government to get a certain kind of information whichever they wanted. No requests to the other institutes need to be made.

b. for legislation 
--
A full version controll system can be implemented. The new laws goes into a branch and  all modifications can be accessed by all, even the publics.

c. for people living in that country 
--
Once edit and can be used by all. The efficiency and  the reuseablity of information is lagely increased 
Bigdata is working. To a optimistic perspective, there might won’t be any “exams” or “evaluations” before the application and graduation, all data of the person is traced and all progress made can be accessed.
Accessibility is defined by permissions. It is the system itself that defines the accessibility of the information, to some degree protects the privacy for the people

d. for other parties 
--
Hospitals, education institus bussinesses, can also be affected in a large way. All the information about a single person is “up-to-date” one, and they themselves can edit  information about the person to make the information more reliable and more in detail.

## 7. SWOT analysis
=====
SWOT analysis from the perspective of the government


### Strengths ###
- less redundancy
- up-to-date information throughout
- less management
- less bureacracy for obtaining data
- creates cost savings in the long run
### Weaknesses ###
- requires careful planning, which might become really expensive
- also, takes a lot of time (see timeframe of eNorway for instance)
### Opportunities ###
- once created, creating additions to standardised data interfaces should be a breeze
- new usage purposes can be added as they appear, further increasing the utilisation of the system, and the benefits of the system
### Threats ###
- if not performed right, can create a huge information security threat, e.g. erroneous permissions etc.
- several sectors are influenced by a possible shortage in this system

## 8. My opinion

Every coin has to sides. To a good view, the business and the government can access the same information, and the information accessed do have a record, and who accessed the information can be recorded in details.
The tax system can also seal the business with the government, make it truely accurate to calculate the amounts that should be paid.
To a perssimetic view, the authority issue can be difficult to decide and complex, which includes which information can be accessed and which cannot.
